faq_qa:
  ask_what_are_color_seasons:
    explanation: >
      The 4 seasonal colour types—Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter—are systems used to categorize people’s natural coloring. Each season reflects a specific mix of undertone (warm/cool), brightness, and depth.

  ask_season_subtypes:
    explanation: >
      Each colour season has subtypes such as Soft, Deep, Cool, or Warm. These subcategories help fine-tune your palette for even more precision.

  ask_how_is_color_season_determined:
    explanation: >
      We analyze your skin undertone, eye colour, natural hair shade, and how your face reacts to different draped fabrics under natural light. Testing is done barefaced to capture your authentic undertone.

  ask_makeup_requirement:
    explanation: >
      We recommend arriving with no foundation, lipstick, or blush. Light concealer is okay. This helps us observe your true skin tone and avoids colour interference.

  ask_session_duration:
    explanation: >
      A full colour analysis session takes 60 to 90 minutes. Packages with body shape or personal shopping may take 3–5 hours.

  ask_palette_given:
    explanation: >
      Yes! You’ll receive a personalised colour palette (physical or digital) with your best colours to guide your wardrobe, makeup, and accessories.

  ask_virtual_session_available:
    explanation: >
      Yes, we offer Zoom and WhatsApp video consultations. You’ll be guided on how to prep lighting and photos beforehand.

  ask_what_to_wear:
    explanation: >
      Wear a white or neutral top. Avoid prints or bold colours. Hijabis can bring a white/beige scarf or use one provided.

  ask_is_color_analysis_inclusive:
    explanation: >
      Absolutely! We welcome men, women, hijabis, students, professionals, and those who don't wear makeup.

  ask_post_session_recommendations:
    explanation: >
      After your session, you’ll receive a full report with colour recommendations, wardrobe tips, and follow-up consultation for 14–30 days depending on your package.

  ask_payment_method:
    explanation: >
      We accept online bank transfers (FPX). Payment is required upfront. DM your receipt via WhatsApp to confirm booking.

  ask_location_or_availability:
    explanation: >
